## **Overview**

This project is developed collaboratively by **Mabhu Subhani** ([GitHub: mabhusubhani001](https://github.com/mabhusubhani001)) and **Vinay** ([GitHub: vinay1011](https://github.com/vinay1011)) as part of the **Impact-Metrics** competition during **Jagriti'25**, IIT (BHU) Varanasi.  
It combines machine learning, real-time data visualization, and interactive systems to analyze and predict seismic activity globally.

## **System Architecture**

![System Architecture Diagram](./images/system_architecture.png)  

The system is structured into the following layers:  
### 1. **Data Processing Layer**
   - Cleanses raw seismic data.
   - Applies feature engineering and data validation.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def preprocess_data(df):
         df['date_time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_time'], format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M')
         df['alert_encoded'] = pd.Categorical(df['alert']).codes
         return df
     ```

### 2. **Machine Learning Layer**
   - Dual-branch neural network for CDI and MMI predictions.  
   - Includes residual blocks and multi-output architecture.  
   - **Model Highlights**:
     - Residual Blocks: Improve gradient flow for deeper networks.  
     - Optimizer: AdamW for adaptive learning rate and weight decay.  

### 3. **Visualization Layer**
   - Interactive 3D globe for mapping events.  
   - Dashboards for real-time statistics and analytics.  
   - ![Globe Visualization](./images/globe_visualization.png)  

### 4. **Alert System Layer**
   - Risk classification based on predicted seismic intensity.  
   - Real-time alerts for high-risk zones.

## **Data and Preprocessing**

The dataset includes 1000 records with the following attributes:  
- **title**: Event description.  
- **magnitude**: Earthquake's magnitude.  
- **date_time**: Event timestamp.  
- **cdi**: Community Internet Intensity.  
- **mmi**: Modified Mercalli Intensity.  
- **depth**: Depth of the earthquake (in km).  
- **latitude** & **longitude**: Geographic location.  
- **alert**: Alert level (Green, Yellow, Orange, Red).  
- **year** & **month**: Derived temporal attributes.  

### **Feature Engineering**
Advanced features were created to enhance predictions:
- **Seismic Energy**:  
   \[
   \text{Seismic Energy} = 10^{(1.5 \times \text{Magnitude} + 4.8)}
   \]
- **Depth-Magnitude Ratio**: Depth scaled by magnitude.

## **Machine Learning Model**

### **Neural Network Architecture**
- **Numerical Input Processing**:
  - Dense layers with residual blocks.
  - Layer normalization and dropout.  
- **Categorical Input Processing**:
  - Encoded features passed through dense layers.  
- **CDI and MMI Outputs**:  
   Separate branches with multi-output layers.

### **Residual Block Implementation**
```python
def residual_block(self, x, units):
    shortcut = x
    x = LayerNormalization()(x)
    x = Dense(units, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01))(x)
    x = Dropout(0.3)(x)
    x = Dense(units, kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01))(x)
    return Add()([x, shortcut]) if shortcut.shape[-1] == units else x
```
